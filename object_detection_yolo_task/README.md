# Object Detection (Using YOLO v5)

Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labelling them.

## Project Motive

To count the number of cars and trucks that'll be seen in given video


## Introduction

Example :  An image that contains two cats and a person. 


Object detection allows us to at once classify the types of things found while also locating instances of them within the image.

YOLO is an acronym that stands for You Only Look Once
It is a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects objects in real-time with great accuracy. 

This approach uses a single neural network to process the entire picture, then separates it into parts and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each component.


IMPORTANCE :

Speed:

This algorithm improves the speed of detection because it can predict objects in real-time.

High accuracy:

YOLO is a predictive technique that provides accurate results with minimal background errors.
Learning capabilities: The algorithm has excellent learning capabilities that enable it to learn the representations of objects and apply them in object detection.


APPLICATIONS:


Vehicle Detection:  Different kind of vehicle i.e. Car, truck, bike, bus, train, boat, bicycle, flights all are detected by Yolo model in an image and real-time both.


Animal Detection :  Yolo model is capable of detecting horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear and zebra, giraffe from images and real time camera feed and recorded videos. It is also capable of detecting cat, dog and bird.


Person Detection : use cases incorporate security applications that track who’s travelling every which way, who’s coming and going just as safety systems intended to keep individuals out of damage’s way.
